# Microsoft Performance Tools Linux

> This repo contains various Linux Performance Analysis tools built with the [Microsoft Performance Toolkit SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-performance-toolkit-sdk).

> Tools are built with open source .NET Core and can be run on the cmd-line or in the WPA GUI. All the logs that are supported are open source. 

>Not only are the raw logs parsed, but a lot of smart post processing / correlation is done to make your life easier as a perf analyst. We hope you can solve & debug tough issues on you or your customers systems with this toolset!

> Tracing supported: [LTTng](https://lttng.org) (Kernel CPU scheduling, Processes, Threads, Block IO/Disk, Syscalls, File events, etc), [perf](https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/) CPU Sampling(cpu-clock)

> Logs supported: [Dmesg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dmesg), [Cloud-Init](https://cloud-init.io/), [WaLinuxAgent](https://github.com/Azure/WALinuxAgent)

**Optional** WPA GUI:

# Prerequisites

## Runtime prereqs
- [.NET Core Runtime 3.1.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)

## Dev prereqs
- [.NET Core SDK 3.1.x](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
- [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VSCode](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), or your favorite editor!

# Download
See [Releases](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Linux/releases)

# How to run the tools
The tools can be run in several modes:

- Cross-platform with .NET Core
  - Used as a library to process traces / logs programatically
    - Examples: 
    - [LTTng 1](LTTngDriver/Program.cs), [LTTng 2](LTTngDataExtUnitTest/LTTngUnitTest.cs)
    - [Perf](PerfUnitTest/PerfUnitTest.cs)
    - [LinuxLogs](LinuxLogParsers/LinuxLogParsersUnitTest/LinuxLogParsersUnitTest.cs)
  - With a driver program for example dumping to screen or text format
    - ./LTTngDriver.exe LTTngKernelTraceFolder
    - ./LTTngDriver.exe LTTng-Kernel-Trace.ctf (trace folder is zipped and renamed to .ctf)
- (Windows Only - Install) Using the WPA GUI to load these tools as plugins
  - Download the latest Windows Performance Toolkit (WPT) that comes in the [ADK Preview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewADK)
	- Note: In the future, the WPA team plans to make it easier to install WPA outside of the ADK
  - Install Windows Performance Toolkit ![Windows Performance Toolkit](Images/ADK_WPT.jpg)
    - Verify that this WPA version supports plugins
    - In Command Prompt
        ```dos
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Windows Performance Toolkit\wpa.exe" /?
        ```
    - Verify that these 2 command line WPA options are supported:
      - OPTIONS: **-addsearchdir PATH**. Adds a directory path to the plugin search path. ....
      - ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES: **WPA_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES** - A semicolon (;) delimited list of additional directories to search for plugins. Equivalent to the -addsearchdir option.
- (Windows Only - Run) Using the WPA GUI to load these tools as plugins
  - WPA needs to be told where to find these additional plugins. 
  - Using [Windows Launcher](Launcher/Windows/LaunchWpaPerfToolsLinux.ps1). -LinuxPerfToolsPluginFolder path may need to be specified
    ```powershell
    .\LaunchWpaPerfToolsLinux.ps1 -i c:\PATH\TO\lttng-kernel-trace.ctf
    ```
  - In Command Prompt with -addsearchdir and -i trace file:
      ```dos
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Windows Performance Toolkit\wpa.exe" -addsearchdir %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Linux-0.8\Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Linux\MicrosoftPerfToolkitAddins -i c:\PATH\TO\lttng-kernel-trace.ctf
     ```
  - OR with Env Variable to pick file from UI (Env variable not currently working in current ADK version)
       ```dos
        SET WPA_ADDITIONAL_SEARCH_DIRECTORIES=%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Downloads\Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Linux-0.8\Microsoft-Performance-Tools-Linux\MicrosoftPerfToolkitAddins
        "C:\Program Files (x86)\Windows Kits\10\Windows Performance Toolkit\wpa.exe"
      ```

- (Coming soon) (Windows) Command-line dumping to a text format (say CSV)

# How to capture a trace or logs
Please see [Linux Trace Log Capture](LinuxTraceLogCapture.md)

# How to load the logs in the UI
Once you gather the data, there is a tiny bit of prep needed to open them in a single unified timeline (like the screenshot above)

- LTTng - If you just need to open only a LTTng trace by itself in folder format
  - WPA -> Open -> Folder (Select CTF folder)
  - Note: Requires >= WPA ADK xxxxx - WPA 10.?.?.?
- Unified (LTTng or other multiple different logs files together)
  - If you want to open other logs together in single timeline - Copy other Linux logs you want to open to single folder
  - Example: You want to open in the same timeline: LTTng, Perf CPU Sampling, Dmesg
  - Ensure that the Linux CTF folder/trace is zipped and renamed to .ctf in the same folder (hack so open Unified works)
  - WPA -> File -> Open -> Multi-select all files and choose "Open Unified"

# How do I use WPA in general?
If you want to learn how to use the GUI UI in general see [WPA MSDN Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/test/wpt/windows-performance-analyzer)
